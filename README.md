# SpeedDraft-SDP
**SuperDiskPerformante**

An application designed to cache files stored on slow disks onto the local hard drive, increasing the speed of computer aided design softwares. The primary intent is to cache directories stored on network accessible storage.

The software allows the user to "check out" a directory's files to their local hard drive, and then "check in" that directory when they are finished working with the cached files. This allows other users of the network accessible storage to view any changes made after they are checked back in.

"Performante" is an Italian word signifying "performing" or "performance" (and is also a model type of the Lamborghini Hurac√°n).

**A component of the SpeedDraft DAS (Drawing Automation System).**

Built in Late 2018 using Java 1.8 x64 build 181 and Eclipse Photon (June 2018).
